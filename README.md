# Gomoku-Reinfocement-Learning
A training environment for deep learning agents playing an arbitrary m,n,k-games [1] such as Tic-tac-toe (connect-3 on 3x3 grid) or Gomoku (connect-5 on 15x15 grid).
Game instance is provided with opponents of various complexity to train against.
Agents can learn to play a given m,n,k-game with deep reinforcement learning techniques such as Deep Q-Networks or Proximal policy optimisation (PPO - not implemented).
